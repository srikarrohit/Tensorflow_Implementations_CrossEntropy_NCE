1. Generating batch:
a. Used collections.deque to maintain a fixed window size and for a queue data structure
b. Initialised the window first
c. Now, we use the probability as a distance measure, with the closest one having the
   highest probability and reduces as the distance grows
d. We convert this probability into frequence measure by generating left and right one
   after another
e. We break once we reach the num_skips value
f. Finally, we return the batch and labels from the function

- CE_Best model Hyperparameters : Overall accuracy: 36%
a. max_num_steps  = 100001
b. batch_size = 64
c. embedding_size = 128
d. skip_window = 2
e. num_skips = 2 
f. num_sampled = 64

- NCE_Best model Hyperparameters : Overall accuracy: 35.7%
a. max_num_steps  = 100001
b. batch_size = 32
c. embedding_size = 128
d. skip_window = 2
e. num_skips = 2 
f. num_sampled = 64
